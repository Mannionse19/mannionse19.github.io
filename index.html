  <h2>Cross Country</h2>
     <img src="XC.JPG" alt="Cross Country" style="width:300px;height:250px;">
  <p> I Joined the Cross Country last second after much encouragement from Mr. Richards, Mr. George, and teamates from last spring. 
      The Cross Country Team won ISL's causing me to receive a letter as a "contributer". While Running may not be my favorite activity
    I appreciate the work enthic the sport breeds as well as the fitness I gained form it. B running Group is for the boys and your goal 
    this year is to be at the top of it, if you don't make A group.</p>
  
    <div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">
  <h2>Basketball</h2>
      <img src="Basketball.JPG" alt="Basketball" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
  <p>The attitude shift from Cross Country to Varisty Basketball cannot be understated. Although I played not as frequently 
    as I would have liked, the expirence I gained from playing with skilled individuals and competitors like Daivd and Jovan 
    helped prepare me for the spring season. Second place in the ISL did not make the class A tournement, Goal is be a consistent
    rock and contributer</p>

  <h2>Rowing</h2>
       <img src="Rowing.JPG" alt="Crew" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
  <p>Going into
      Crew season I was not expecting much because of the critical decision I had made earlier in the year to play basketball rather
      than winter training. No one could have predicted the improvments I made and by the first race I was sitting in the bow of the
      first boat. From last year when I was one second from the hall of fame (4:50 1500m) I dropped over ten seconds to pull on the
      last erg test of this year a 4:39.6. Sean this is proof to yourself that effort brings results and you need to use this for
      encouragement over the summer and into next year. Second seed going into NEIRA's lost our fattest ergo r.i.p. Bobby J. Goal next 
      year is to beat his record, aim high</p>
